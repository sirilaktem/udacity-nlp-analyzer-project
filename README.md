# Development

The starter code of this project is provided [here](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/evaluate-news-nlp), but I decided to develop this project from scratch using the free design from [Untitled UI](https://www.untitledui.com/).

This project is built using third-party resources as follow:

-   Quicksand and Reenie Beanie fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
-   Sentiment Analysis API version 2.1 by [MeaningCloud](https://learn.meaningcloud.com/developer/sentiment-analysis/2.1/doc/what-is-sentiment-analysis)
